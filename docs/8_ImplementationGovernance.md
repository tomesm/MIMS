## 8. Implementation Governance

In this phase, we monitor and control the implementation of the architecture, ensuring alignment with the target architecture. We will also establish a change management process to handle updates and modifications to the architecture.

### 8.1 Monitoring and Control

To ensure the successful implementation of the Mars Immigration System, it's crucial to monitor and control the progress and quality of the project. The following steps will be taken to ensure effective governance:

1. **Regular status reporting**: The project team will provide regular status updates to stakeholders, including progress against milestones, risks, and issues.
2. **Architecture alignment reviews**: Periodic reviews will be conducted to ensure that the implemented solution remains aligned with the target architecture.
3. **Quality assurance**: The project team will implement quality assurance processes, such as code reviews, automated testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure the quality of the implemented system.
4. **Risk management**: Risks will be identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the project, with regular updates provided to stakeholders.

### 8.2 Change Management Process

Changes to the architecture can be expected throughout the project lifecycle. To effectively manage these changes, a change management process will be established:

1. **Change request submission**: Stakeholders or team members can submit change requests that detail the proposed change, its rationale, and its potential impact on the project.
2. **Impact assessment**: The project team will assess the change request, considering factors such as cost, timeline, risks, and alignment with the target architecture.
3. **Change approval**: The change request, along with the impact assessment, will be submitted to a Change Advisory Board (CAB) for review and approval. The CAB may consist of project stakeholders, team leads, and subject matter experts.
4. **Implementation**: If approved, the change will be implemented in the system, and the target architecture will be updated accordingly.
5. **Communication**: The project team will communicate the change to relevant stakeholders and update any related documentation.

This change management process ensures that changes to the architecture are managed effectively and that the implemented system remains aligned with the target architecture.
