# 5. Technology Architecture

In this section, we will define the technology stack and infrastructure components that will be used to build, deploy, and maintain the Mars immigration system.

## 5.1 Technology Stack

The following technology stack will be used to develop the Mars immigration system:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React.js (web) or React Native (mobile)
- **Database**: CockroachDB (distributed SQL database)
- **Orchestration & Deployment**: Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure**: Local Mars station Kubernetes cluster

## 5.2 Infrastructure Components

### Cloud Services

- **Kubernetes**: A container orchestration platform used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Local Mars station Kubernetes cluster**: A local Kubernetes cluster deployed within the Mars station to support the Mars immigration system. This will ensure low latency and independence from Earth-based services.

### Databases

- **CockroachDB**: A cloud-native, distributed SQL database that provides horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and survivability. It will be used to store all data related to passengers, visas, colonies, users, and docking bays.

### Networking

- **Local 5G Network**: A local 5G network provided within the Mars station to enable seamless communication between passengers, immigration officers, station managers, spaceline dispatchers, and colony officials.

## 5.3 Technology Considerations

- The use of Kubernetes allows for easy scaling and management of the system components, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

- The local Kubernetes cluster within the Mars station provides low-latency access to the system, reducing reliance on Earth-based services and ensuring smooth operation even during communication delays or outages.

- CockroachDB provides a distributed SQL database that meets the requirements for data consistency, survivability, and scalability, while also allowing for easy integration with the Python-based backend.

- The local 5G network ensures high-speed communication between all system actors, supporting real-time interactions and data access.
