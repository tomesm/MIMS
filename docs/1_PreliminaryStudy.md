# Mars Immigration System: Preliminary Study
This document describes the preliminary phase of the Mars Immigration System's architecture design, based on TOGAF's Architecture Development Method (ADM).

##Scope

The scope of the Mars Immigration System includes:

- Local Kubernetes cluster running Python microservices on stations.
- Registration of passengers via web or mobile application after docking.
- Connection to a local 5G network for all passengers upon arrival.
- Backend REST API endpoints to support frontend applications.
- Role-based frontend applications for passengers and immigration officers.

## Governance Structure

A governance structure for the Mars Immigration System should be established to ensure proper planning, development, and maintenance. Key roles in the governance structure may include:

- Project Sponsor: Responsible for securing funding and resources, as well as setting the overall direction for the project.
- Enterprise Architect: Oversees the architecture design process and ensures alignment with the project's vision and objectives.
- Solution Architects: Develop the technical components of the system, such as microservices, data models, and API endpoints.
- Developers: Implement the system's applications and components based on the architecture design.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures the system meets performance, security, and reliability requirements.
- Operations Team: Responsible for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the system.

## Architecture Vision and Principles

The architecture vision for the Mars Immigration System should aim to:

- Provide a secure and efficient platform for passengers to apply for visas and access guidance related to Mars immigration.
- Enable immigration officers to effectively manage visa applications and enforce immigration rules.
- Support future growth and expansion, as well as integration with other systems.

Key architecture principles for the Mars Immigration System may include:

- Scalability: Design the system to handle varying workloads and accommodate growth.
- Flexibility: Use modular components and microservices to enable easy updates and feature additions.
- Security: Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of passenger data and system components.
- Performance: Optimize the system for fast response times and efficient resource utilization.
- Maintainability: Use clear, consistent coding standards and documentation to enable easy maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Requirements

Requirements for the Mars Immigration System should be gathered from stakeholders and prioritized based on their importance and feasibility. Some potential requirements may include:

- Secure authentication and role-based access control for passengers and immigration officers.
- User-friendly web and mobile applications for passengers to apply for visas and access guidance.
- Efficient workflows for immigration officers to review, approve, or deny visa applications.
- Integration with external systems, such as colony-specific immigration rules or interplanetary travel records.
- Reporting and analytics capabilities to support decision-making and policy development.
