The ReportingService should be responsible for providing a forecast of passenger capacity for the next 6 months. This service is responsible for generating various reports and analytics for stakeholders to review and make informed decisions based on the data. It can gather the required information from other microservices, such as the FlightManagementService and SpacelineManagementMicroservice, which handle flight schedules and spacecraft capacities, and then use this data to generate forecasts for future passenger capacity.
