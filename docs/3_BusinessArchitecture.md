# 3. Business Architecture

In this section, we will outline the business architecture of the Mars immigration system, focusing on the key business processes, organizational structure, and actors involved in the system.

A role-based access control system (RBAC) will be used for this system. It allows to define roles with specific permissions, and then assign these roles to users. This makes it easier to manage user access and maintain security.


## 3.1 Business Processes

The primary business processes of the Mars immigration system include:

1. **Passenger Registration**: Passengers arriving at the Mars station register using the web or mobile application.

2. **Visa Application**: Registered passengers apply for a temporary visa based on the available options (6, 12, 18, or 24 Mars months).

3. **Visa Approval**: Immigration officers review and process visa applications, approving or denying them based on the colony's immigration rules.

4. **Resource Allocation**: Colony officials allocate and distribute resources, such as power, water, and supplies, to new visitors.

5. **Station Operations**: The station manager oversees the smooth functioning of the station's facilities, infrastructure, and systems.

6. **Spacecraft and Shuttle Operations** Dispatchers are responsible for smooth assigning docking bays.

## 3.2 Roles

The Mars immigration system's organizational structure consists of the following roles:

- **Passenger**: Individuals arriving at the Mars station who need to register and apply for a visa. Uses the web or mobile application to register and apply for a visa.
- **Immigration Officer**: Responsible for reviewing and processing visa applications.
- **Station Manager**: Manages and oversees the operations of the Mars station.
- **Colony Official**: Sets immigration rules and regulations for the colony.
- **Spaceline Dispatcher**: Coordinates with the Mars station regarding passenger arrivals and departures.
- **Station Dispatcher**: Coordinates with a colony the shuttle traffic from station to colony and vice versa.
- **SystemAdministrator**: Poweruser/maintainer of the system.

## 3.3 Key critical parts

### 1. Insufficient resource tracking and allocation

The most critical part of this system is tracking and allocating resources accurately. If there are errors in updating the colony_resource or resource_limit dictionaries, it may lead to incorrect resource allocation or denial of resources to passengers when they should have been granted. This could cause issues in the functioning of the colony and may affect the well-being of the passengers.

### 2. Scalability and performance 

As the colony grows and the number of resource requests increases, the system needs to handle the growing demand efficiently. Poorly designed algorithms or data structures may result in reduced performance or even system failure, leading to problems in resource management for the colony.

### 3. Error handling and edge cases 

Another critical aspect of the system is its ability to handle errors and edge cases effectively. For example, if there is a sudden depletion of a specific resource or if there are multiple concurrent requests for resources, the system must be able to handle these situations without causing disruptions. Failure to do so could lead to critical resources being unavailable to passengers, impacting their well-being and the overall operation of the colony.

Another edge case would be failure of Shuttle and SPacecraft assignment.

### 4. Security and authentication 

Ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and request resources is essential to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or manipulation of the system. A lack of proper security measures could lead to resource theft, misallocation, or even sabotage, putting the entire colony at risk.

### 5. Data integrity and backup

The system relies on accurate data to make resource allocation decisions. Data corruption, loss, or tampering could lead to incorrect decisions and potentially catastrophic consequences for the colony. Regular backups and data integrity checks should be in place to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system's data.


### 6. Communication and synchronization

In a distributed system or if there are multiple parties involved in the resource allocation process, it is crucial to have effective communication and synchronization mechanisms. If updates to the colony's resources are not communicated or synchronized properly, it could lead to inconsistencies in the system, resulting in either over-allocation or denial of resources when they should have been granted. This could negatively affect the colony's operations and the well-being of its passengers.
