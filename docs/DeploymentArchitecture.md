1. Database
    - A scalable and distributed database to store data entities such as passengers, immigration officers, spacelines, colonies, orbital stations, and flights. Example: Amazon DynamoDB or Google Cloud Firestore.

2. Backend Servers
    - A set of stateless, horizontally scalable RESTful API servers implementing the business logic for the system. These servers would interact with the database and handle requests from the frontend application. They would be hosted on a cloud provider and deployed within containers or using serverless functions. Example: Amazon EC2 or Google Cloud Run.

3. Frontend Application
    - A web-based application that provides the user interface for the system actors (passengers, immigration officers, spaceline dispatchers, colony officials, and station managers). The application would interact with the backend servers through RESTful API calls. Example: React or Angular.

4. Load Balancer
    - A load balancer to distribute incoming requests among the backend servers, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization. Example: Amazon ELB or Google Cloud Load Balancer.

5. Authentication and Authorization
    - A secure authentication and authorization system to manage access control for different system actors. This can be achieved using an identity and access management service. Example: Amazon Cognito or Google Cloud Identity Platform.

6. Networking
    - Properly configured networking to enable secure communication between the frontend, backend, and database components, as well as to ensure that long delays in communication are handled properly. This can be achieved using virtual private clouds and appropriate routing configurations. Example: Amazon VPC or Google Cloud VPC.

7. Monitoring and Logging
    - A monitoring and logging system to track the performance, availability, and security of the deployed components. This can be achieved using a combination of monitoring and logging services. Example: Amazon CloudWatch or Google Cloud Operations Suite.
