## 7. Migration and Planning

In this phase, we prioritize projects and initiatives based on the defined opportunities and solutions. We will develop a roadmap for implementing the target architecture.

The following projects and initiatives have been prioritized based on their impact, feasibility, and alignment with the Mars Immigration System goals:

1. **Development of the Passenger Registration System**: This is the core functionality of the Mars Immigration System and will be the primary focus of our efforts.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**: Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster for hosting the microservices is crucial for achieving the required reliability and scalability.
3. **Docking Bay Dispatch System**: Implementing a system for managing docking bay allocations and scheduling is essential for smooth operation.
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implementing a role-based access control system ensures that different user roles have appropriate access to the system.
5. **Reporting and Analytics**: Developing reporting and analytics tools will provide valuable insights into the immigration process and help improve the system over time.


In total, the Development Plan is estimated to take 9 months from initiation to completion.
