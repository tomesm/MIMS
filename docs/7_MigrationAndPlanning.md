## 7. Migration Planning

In this phase, we prioritize projects and initiatives based on the defined opportunities and solutions. We will develop a roadmap for implementing the target architecture.

### 7.1 Prioritization

The following projects and initiatives have been prioritized based on their impact, feasibility, and alignment with the Mars Immigration System goals:

1. **Development of the Passenger and Cargo Registration System**: This is the core functionality of the Mars Immigration System and will be the primary focus of our efforts.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**: Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster for hosting the microservices is crucial for achieving the required reliability and scalability.
3. **Docking Bay Dispatch System**: Implementing a system for managing docking bay allocations and scheduling is essential for smooth operation.
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implementing a role-based access control system ensures that different user roles have appropriate access to the system.
5. **Reporting and Analytics**: Developing reporting and analytics tools will provide valuable insights into the immigration process and help improve the system over time.

### 7.2 Roadmap

The roadmap for implementing the target architecture is as follows:

1. **Phase 1**: Development of core functionalities, including the Passenger and Cargo Registration System, Role-Based Access Control, and basic reporting.
    - Duration: 3 months
    - Key deliverables: Functional MVP, initial user testing
2. **Phase 2**: Setting up the Kubernetes cluster and deploying the microservices.
    - Duration: 2 months
    - Key deliverables: Kubernetes cluster setup, microservices deployment, performance testing
3. **Phase 3**: Implementation of the Docking Bay Dispatch System and integration with the Registration System.
    - Duration: 2 months
    - Key deliverables: Docking Bay Dispatch System, integration testing
4. **Phase 4**: Enhancement of reporting and analytics capabilities.
    - Duration: 1 month
    - Key deliverables: Advanced reporting and analytics tools
5. **Phase 5**: System optimization, bug fixes, and final user testing.
    - Duration: 1 month
    - Key deliverables: System optimization, final user testing, and preparation for launch

In total, the Migration Plan is estimated to take 9 months from initiation to completion.
