## 9. Architecture Change Management

The purpose of Architecture Change Management is to ensure that the architecture remains aligned with the business requirements and adapts to any changes that may arise.

### 9.1 Change Management Process

To manage changes effectively, we will establish a change management process, which consists of the following steps:

1. **Change Request**: Stakeholders submit change requests describing the proposed change, its rationale, and potential impacts on the system.
2. **Change Assessment**: The architecture team assesses the change request, evaluating its feasibility, alignment with the current architecture, and potential risks and benefits.
3. **Approval or Rejection**: Based on the assessment, the architecture board or relevant decision-making body approves or rejects the change request.
4. **Implementation**: If approved, the development team implements the change, following the guidelines established in the TOGAF document and any additional instructions provided during the approval process.
5. **Validation**: The architecture team validates the implemented change, ensuring it meets the requirements and adheres to the architecture.

### 9.2 Change Monitoring and Control

To ensure that changes are implemented correctly and the architecture remains consistent, the architecture team will monitor and control the change implementation process, which includes:

- Reviewing the progress of changes against the established roadmap and timelines.
- Ensuring that the development team follows the architectural guidelines and best practices during the implementation.
- Identifying and addressing any deviations from the planned architecture or potential risks that may arise.

### 9.3 Continuous Improvement

The architecture team will periodically review the architecture to identify areas for improvement, taking into account new technologies, business requirements, and other factors that may influence the system's performance and effectiveness. These improvements may be introduced through the change management process or as part of the regular architecture update cycle.
