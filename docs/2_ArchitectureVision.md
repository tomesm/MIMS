# 2. Architecture Vision

The Mars Immigration System aims to provide a seamless, secure, and efficient process for managing the immigration of passengers arriving at Mars colonies. The system will be built on a microservices architecture, utilizing Kubernetes and Python to ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

## 2.1 Goals and Objectives

- Implement a role-based access control system for different user roles such as passengers and immigration officers.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for passengers to apply for visas and access guidance.
- Enable immigration officers to efficiently review, approve, or deny visa applications.
- Ensure data security and privacy for all users.

## 2.2 Architecture Principles

1. **Scalability**: The system should be designed to handle a growing number of users and requests without degrading performance.
2. **Modularity**: The system should be built using a modular approach, allowing for easy addition, removal, or modification of components.
3. **Security**: The system should be built with a strong focus on data security and privacy, ensuring the protection of sensitive information.
4. **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to maintain, with clear documentation and a well-structured codebase.
5. **Flexibility**: The system should be adaptable to changing requirements and evolving technology.

## 2.3 High-Level Architecture

The Mars Immigration System will be composed of the following main components:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: The cluster will run locally on Mars stations, providing a scalable and resilient platform for running microservices.
- **Python Microservices**: The backend will consist of REST API endpoints, implemented as microservices in Python.
- **Frontend Applications**: Web and mobile applications will be built on top of the APIs, providing a user-friendly interface for passengers and immigration officers.

### 2.3.1 Kubernetes Cluster

The Kubernetes cluster will be responsible for orchestrating and managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of the microservices. This cluster will run locally on Mars stations, ensuring a high level of availability and performance.

### 2.3.2 Python Microservices

The backend will be implemented as a collection of microservices written in Python. These microservices will expose REST API endpoints, enabling communication between the frontend applications and the underlying data stores. The microservices will be responsible for implementing business logic, managing data, and enforcing access control based on user roles.

### 2.3.3 Frontend Applications

The frontend applications will provide a user interface for passengers and immigration officers to interact with the system. These applications will be built on top of the REST APIs provided by the backend microservices, allowing users to access system functionality through a web browser or mobile app.

## 2.4 Stakeholders and Concerns

- **Passengers**: Passengers will be the primary users of the system, seeking to apply for visas and access guidance on Mars immigration procedures. Their main concerns will be ease of use, security, and privacy.
- **Immigration Officers**: Immigration officers will be responsible for reviewing, approving, or denying visa applications. Their main concerns will be efficiency, accuracy, and security.
- **Spaceline Dispatchers**: Spaceline dispatchers will be responsible for coordinating passenger transport between Earth and Mars. Their main concerns will be efficient communication with the immigration system and accurate passenger information.
- **Colony Officials**: Colony officials will be involved in setting immigration policies and monitoring the overall immigration process. Their main concerns will be compliance with regulations and efficient management of the immigration system.
- **Station Managers**: Station managers see crucial metrics ofthe station operations. They can see flight schedules and plans dock bay maintenance accordingly.
- **System Administrators**: System administrators will be responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster and ensuring the smooth operation of the system. Their main concerns will be scalability, maintainability, and security.
