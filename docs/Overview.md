# Overview

Here's a suggested architecture design for the Cybero's Mars Immigration System based on TOGAF's Architecture Development Method (ADM):

## 1. Preliminary Phase:

Define the scope of the project and set up the necessary governance structure.
Establish the architecture vision and secure buy-in from stakeholders.
Define principles and requirements for the Mars Immigration System.

## 2. Architecture Vision:

Develop a high-level vision of the system, including goals, objectives, and a mission statement.
Identify key stakeholders and their concerns.

## 3. Business Architecture:

Model the business processes involved in the Mars Immigration System, such as visa application, approval, and enforcement.
Identify the roles and responsibilities of different actors in the system, such as applicants, immigration officers, and government officials.

## 4. Information Systems Architecture:

Data Architecture: Define the data entities, relationships, and data flows within the system, such as passengers, visas, and colonies.
Application Architecture: Design the system's applications and their interactions, such as the visa application portal, immigration database, and reporting tools.

## 5. Technology Architecture:

Define the technology stack and infrastructure components, such as cloud services, databases, and networking.
Consider the use of Kubernetes, serverless architecture, or other technologies that meet the system's requirements and constraints.

## 6. Opportunities and Solutions:

Identify opportunities for improvement, such as process automation or integration with other systems.

Develop solution building blocks and a migration plan to achieve the target architecture.

## 7. Migration Planning:

Prioritize projects and initiatives based on the defined opportunities and solutions.
Develop a roadmap for implementing the target architecture.

## 8. Implementation Governance:

Monitor and control the implementation of the architecture, ensuring alignment with the target architecture.

Establish a change management process to handle updates and modifications to the architecture.

## 9. Architecture Change Management:

Continuously monitor the Mars Immigration System to identify areas for improvement and optimization.

Adjust the architecture as necessary to address changes in requirements, technology, or the environment.
